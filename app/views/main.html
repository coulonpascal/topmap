    <p>
        This portal has been created to share earth observation data and other 
        widely used geographic information (GI) datasets across the DEFRA Group. 
        Delivering centrally managed datasets is expected to save time and money 
        as group members will not have to manage these large datasets in-house. 
        The node will also allow for cloud-hosted data processing facilities 
        which should enable larger scale data processing which again does not 
        have to be hosted and managed through local infrastructure; the outputs 
        of which can be readily shared where appropriate.
